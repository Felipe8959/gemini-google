Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language. 
Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. 
Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. 
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. 
Due to its comprehensive standard library, Python is often described as a "batteries included" language.
